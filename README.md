# BWSS [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/Anon10W1z/bwss.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/Anon10W1z/bwss) 
BedWars Statistical Suite (BWSS) is a statistical tracker for the mini game Bed Wars on the Hypixel server.
BedWars games are automatically tracked and logged to files, which can then be processed.
An example utility (bwss.py) is included in the viewer folder and is packaged with every release.

BWSS supports Minecraft Forge with Minecraft version 1.8.9, and the utility uses Python 3.6 with Tkinter.
Tkinter should be installed on Windows by default with Python 3, but on Linux, sudo apt-get install python3-tk may be necessary.

The utility can be run rather simply in a terminal / CMD prompt: python3 bwss.py
